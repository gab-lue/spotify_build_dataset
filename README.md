 Spotify API, getting latest data and building DataFrame from Scratch

 # Working with spotify web api in python with spotipy

 In this notebook the spotify web api will be used with the help of spotipy, a special spotify api package.

 The spotify web api will provide all necessary data that will build up to the latest music datasets in 2020

 ### Following steps are included in the notebook:

  - web api calls with spotypy
  - extracting data from the api as json
  - building pandas DataFrame from the web api data
  - storing the data into csv files for later analysis

 .
 ### Goal

 On later analysis will be focused on the most popular tracks in 2020. \
 Means, for the dataset we need spotify playlist for most streamed track and artist, globally and for germany.

 Track information and artist information are necessary. Also the popularity value, a spotify index, is key for later analysis.\
 #### Although the spotify audio features, values from their AI analysis, which will index specific features of how the music sound (e.g acoustic, danceability), will be gathered and stored for each track id.
